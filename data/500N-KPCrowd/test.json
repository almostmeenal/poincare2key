Microsoft says that Windows Phone 7\"\"s app marketplace is booming. In a chest-beating blog post, Microsoft revealed that WinPho7\"\"s app count stands at 11,500, and that's without wallpapers or duplicate apps in different languages. The ecosystem has 36,000 developers, 60 percent of which haven't even published anything yet, so the potential for growth is huge. Still, some tech pundits, such as Robert Scoble, insist that a lack of apps is the only reason Windows Phone 7 hasn't been a rousing success. How can this be true if the Windows Phone Marketplace is hopping with activity? First, a bit of qualification: We don't know with absolute certainty that Windows Phones aren't selling. Microsoft has only said how many phones it's sold to retailers (1.5 million as of late December), not the number of people who've actually bought one. But LG has expressed disappointment with sales, and one U.K. retailer claimed that Android phones outsell Windows Phones by a 15 to 1 ratio. It's safe to say that Windows Phone 7 hasn't been a rousing success. Windows Phone 7\"\"s Real Challenges But is a lack of apps to blame? I doubt it. When I consider which phone to buy or recommend to friends, I'm quick to rule out Windows Phone 7, but not because of apps. The platform's lack of multitasking and HTML5 support are much bigger drawbacks. Same with copy and paste, at least until Microsoft finishes rolling out the \"\"NoDo\"\" software update. And until Windows Phones come to Verizon Wireless, the number of people who can even consider the platform is limited. Windows Phone 7 hardware has also been unimpressive so far. Most handsets don't have front-facing cameras. None have dual-core processors. Most lack expandable storage, which wouldn't be an issue if they included more than 8 GB or 16 GB of on-board storage. Every time an Android phone pushes the hardware envelope, Windows Phone 7 falls further behind. If none of those issues existed, apps might linger in the back of my mind, but I doubt it. After all, Windows Phone 7 has a great gaming platform in Xbox Live. It has apps for Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, Shazam, IMDB and even Netflix, which Android still lacks. With Microsoft's new stats in mind, I simply don't buy the argument that apps are holding the platform back. If anything, they're the biggest bright spot for Windows Phone 7 so far.", "politics_world-20797245": "East Coast services disrupted after collision.

DORTMUND, Germany, April 1 (UPI) - A 25-year-old German man has been arrested for allegedly burying a cache of bombs near a German soccer stadium in a blackmail plot, authorities say. The unnamed German national was arrested in Cologne on Tuesday after allegedly placing the explosives in a parking garage near the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, home of the Borussia Dortmund team, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation told The Local news agency. The bombs were safely defused, and three more were found at the man's home in Krefeld, officials said. Investigators said they began tracking the man after he e-mailed the German Embassy in Pakistan, offering information about two planned attacks in Germany by a group. The warning appeared to be a blackmail bid and was worded like an unsolved attempted blackmail case last year. \"\"The suspect apparently acted alone with a general criminal motive,\"\" a federal spokesman said. \"\"There are absolutely no ties to terrorist or Islamist organizations.\"\" Authorities say he admitted placing the bombs.

Josh is the co-founder of a new startup called Torbit which automatically optimizes websites for speed. Yesterday Google announced Page Speed Online, which provides a quick and easy way to accurately measure the speed of your website directly from the web. Previously available only as a browser add-on, Google Labs launch allows you to analyze your site from anywhere and receive instant feedback on making it faster. Chances are, your website could perform better - all of ours could. There are a lot of tools online that only measure server response time, giving an inaccurate picture of your site's speed. For example, blazing fast servers might return your HTML in a fraction of a second, but visitors to your site will still be waiting for images to download or javascript to be executed. In contrast, Page Speed Online uses a webkit-based renderer to time all components of your site for a more complete picture of its performance. Page Speed Online is simple to use. Just enter a URL and get instant suggestions for performance improvements on your site. Page Speed Online gives you a score out of 100 and breaks down suggestions by their priority. Google caches the results, making it faster to use than comparative tools like WebPageTest which offers more features. With Page Speed Online you can also get mobile-specific recommendations. For instance, since mobile device CPUs are less powerful than desktop CPUs, suggestions that reduce CPU consumption will be featured more prominently. Performance matters. We all know that. Everyone can relate to the frustration of waiting on a site that takes forever to load. Website owners in particular should care about performance. The correlation between the speed of your website and revenue has been shown over and over again. Improving your site's performance is the easiest way to increase pageviews, conversions and sales. For example, Yahoo found that a 400ms improvement to the speed of their site increased their pageviews by 9%. Firefox shaved 2.2 seconds off their average page load time and increased download conversions by 15.4%. Shopzilla reduced their loading time from 7 seconds to 2 and increased their pageviews by 25% and revenue by 7-12%. Google has been a long-time champion of making the internet faster. Not only did it rise to prominence by being the fastest search engine, but it also encourages other sites to be fast by using site speed in its web search ranking. Google has also released a slew of tools to help website owners measure and improve the performance of their sites. Google released Page Speed plugins for Firefox and Chrome and include performance data in its webmaster tools. Just yesterday, Steve Souders announced HTTPArchive which keeps an archive of how top websites are built and tracks their performance ranking over time. The data is being recorded using real browsers so the archive is an accurate representation of the experience of actual visitors. Performance is obviously a priority for Google and it's something we all value. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson even calls speed \"\"the #1 feature for startups\"\". Page Speed Online is an important step for the web because it's lowering the bar for people who want to do performance analysis on their sites. You no longer have to download desktop software, install a plugin or even have a copy of the browser that you're testing \u2013 all you need is any browser. Google employee and performance guru, Steve Souders told me a story from a party he attended where a startup CTO was asking him for site improvement suggestions: I didn\u2019t have my laptop handy and was about to give up, but then I remembered Page Speed Online. From my mobile phone I was able to run his site through Page Speed Online and give him specific performance fixes. On top of that were the suggestions for mobile. Page Speed Online provides performance analysis for any website for desktop and mobile from any web client. I also talked with the tech lead for Page Speed Online, Bryan McQuade and asked him what was next for the service. He says: Going forward we\u2019re planning to add even more mobile-targeted analysis to the open-source Page Speed SDK, which powers Page Speed Online, our Page Speed browser extensions, and is used by WebPagetest and other sites. Of course, Page Speed Online will only tell you that your site is slow; it won't fix it for you (although there is an Apache module that helps). Our company, Torbit, and others such as Disrupt runner-up CloudFlare and Blaze.io, are working to automate all these best-practises to make websites fast. Torbit is still in private BETA, but you can sign up now to get in before our public launch.", "business-20903055": "Alaska oil bill draws early fire.

The return of orca Tilikum to SeaWorld's Believe show on March 30th after an absence of more than a year brought out the crowds to welcome the big guy back. Tili is a crowd pleaser because his sheer size allows him to soak the crowds very effectively as he swims by to chants of \"\"Shamu! Shamu!\"\" The park is debuting a new orca show, One Ocean, in late April, which will no doubt draw even more people. So how do you see the orca show at SeaWorld most effectively? Here are some tips: 1) Arrive at Shamu Stadium early. The stadium opens about half an hour before show time, although people line up before that on the busiest days. There are refreshment stands and restrooms at the stadium, so you can get munchies, souvenirs and drinks or make a quick pitstop once you get there. The stadium is massive, so it only reaches capacity on the busiest days, but you won't have a good seat choice if you get there late. 2) Choose your entrance carefully. There are multiple entrances to Shamu Stadium, so don't just jump into the first line you see on a crowded day. Walk around the stadium and see if you can find something shorter. 3) Be prepared if you sit in the soak section. You really do get wet in the danger zone, especially now that Tili is back. Splashing is a big crowd pleasure, so it's likely to be part of the new show, too. Wear a poncho if you don't want to get your clothes wet, and stash fragile items like cameras and cell phone in plastic bags to protect them. Ride Atlantis, the park's water ride, after sitting in the soak zone since you are already wet, or ride it before the show. Advertisement 4) Don't rush out at the end. People tend to jump up and hurry to the exits once the show is over. Rather than fighting the crowd, I like to relax for a bit. Sometimes the trainers are around at the end, so you can have a nice chat with them until the massive pack of people is gone. Click here to see a video of Tili's first return performance.

By Nathan Koppel We tend to think of Seattle in stereotypical ways: earthy, mellow, panoramic, rainy. But it's not all Patagonia and lattes out there, as the news yesterday about the Justice Department's investigation of Seattle police would indicate. The DOJ is looking into a possible pattern of the SPD using excessive force and discriminating against minorities, Justice announced here yesterday. At issue in the federal investigation are several high-profile incidents involving police violence. Last April, a detective was videotaped kicking a Latino robbery suspect and stating that he would beat the \"\"Mexican piss\"\" out of the suspect; In June, an officer was videotaped punching a 17-year-old African American girl who protested the arrest of a friend for jaywalking; and, In August, police shot a Native American woodcarver after he faied to drop his carving knife.

The Return of Lace as a Major Fashion Trend is Giving a Boost to a Once-Faltering European Business Caudry, France Lace, suddenly, is everywhere. Looking nothing like your grandmother's doilies, lace is the fabric of whole dresses and suits for summer, as well as next fall. Lace hasn't been this popular since Queen Victoria sat on the throne. The lavish lace is a dramatic change\u2014not only for high fashion but also for a European industry that has been dwindling since the 1920s. Europe was once famous for lace\u2014hundreds of types of Swiss, Belgian, French and at one point even English lace. Now, much of the lace shown on high-end runways comes from one town in northeastern France. The French lace industry was famous when Jerry Lee Lewis crooned, \"\"Chantilly lace and a pretty face....\"\" in the 1950s. But Chantilly lace is no longer made in the French town of Chantilly. The high-end lace industry has mostly shrunk to the area around a town called Caudry, where rival companies Sophie Hallette and Solstiss supply the likes of Christian Dior, Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Jason Wu and Valentino. The region is known for its stinky Maroilles cheese and the slurry of its \"\"Ch'tis\"\" dialect, made famous in France by the 2008 comedy \"\"Bienvenue Chez Les Ch'tis\"\" or \"\"Welcome to the Sticks.\"\" The factories here specialize in \"\"Leavers\"\" lace, using looms that imitate the intricate knotting of 18th-century handmade lace. These machine looms, named after the Englishman who invented them, can work cotton, silk, rayon, polyester, wool or other materials into exquisite laces that are sturdier than they look. (Handmade lace is now a hobbyist's product, though some machine lace is embellished by hand.) Of course, the Leavers machines are far slower than the knitting machines now used to make mass-market lace in China. Heidi Cho, who trades in lace at Victorian Lace & Trim, a Los Angeles-based lace wholesaler, sells large quantities of Chinese lace to fast-fashion and budget-clothing manufacturers in the U.S. \"\"The China quality is low, but the price is low, Ms. Cho says. Created with an entirely different technique, it isn't nearly as nuanced or beautiful. Still, Chinese factories haven't made headway into the market for couture-level lace\u2014largely because new Leavers machines haven't been manufactured in decades. Outside of bridal trims and lingerie, lace hasn't been a big part of women's wardrobes in recent decades. Perhaps that's partly because it's so truly, almost wholly feminine\u2014in an era when women have been focused on competing with men. The fashion industry's most contrarian designer, Miuccia Prada, prepared the way for lace's comeback. For fall 2008, she used heavy Swiss-made lace\u2014a type more often used in curtains\u2014in Prada's skirts, dresses and accessories. French lace makers celebrated, knowing Prada was likely to influence other designers. Sophie Hallette's U.S. sales representative, Jane Pincus, recalls that she was at a Paris fabric trade show in the spring of 2008 when word spread about the huge Prada order. \"\"There was champagne popping in the booth,\"\" she says. \"\"The sheer size\u2014they put it on every product\u2014the shoes, the bags.\"\" Then the financial crisis hit, with Lehman Brothers collapsing in September. Many designers stripped expensive details from their collections to slash prices. In late 2009, Don O'Neill, designer of the midpriced Theia line, used a wedge of Sophie Hallette lace at the neck of a gown that was priced for retail at $450. He says one U.S. luxury retailer asked him to use cheaper Chinese lace to bring the price of the dress closer to $350. The French lace cost $22.33 per yard, compared with $2 or $3 per yard for lace from China, he says. This wasn't the most expensive lace\u2014in fact, the average wholesale price of Sophie Hallette lace is about $63 a yard, says Maud Lescroart, the company's head of marketing. At retail, a garment is often priced at five or six times what it cost the designer to make, after markups by the brand, the retailer and sometimes middlemen. So $20 of lace can raise the ultimate price of a dress by $100. \"\"They didn't understand why I wouldn't just put Chinese lace on it,\"\" says Mr. O'Neill, who refused to switch laces. Not every designer made the same decision. During the financial crisis, Sophie Hallette, which also owns the Riechers Marescot lace brand, laid off 25% of its work force in Caudry\u2014a painful time for the family-owned company. Now, as the world economy sputters along in recovery mode, lace has a fresh new appeal for designers. Indeed, European couture lace provides a near-perfect metaphor for what's going on in the luxury market, where designers have been rethinking classic materials from mink to pearls. Lace is expensive and utterly traditional, yet it's being put to use in a modern, whole-hog way, such as a hoop-shaped lace skirt from Yohji Yamamoto or Valentino's winter coat with lace stitched over a more substantial fabric. Some of the machines in action at the Sophie Hallette factory in Caudry are 100 years old, says Ms. Lescroart, who is the 38-year-old granddaughter of the company's founder. Many jobs are inherited from parents. Eric Lernon operates a tulle loom that his father worked on as a tulliste . \"\"It's like a 19th-century company in the 21st century,\"\" Ms. Lescroart says, glancing around the factory floor where she spent a good deal of her childhood. In a showroom, she and creative director Pierre Alain Cornaz pull out lace trims so complex that it takes a person two days to make one meter. Often details such as embroidery, sequins and other embellishments are added by hand. New lace patterns from Mr. Cornaz are drawn by hand\u2014every single thread \u2014by a team at the factory. The lace patterns they were drawing in February 2011 will be seen on runways more than a year later, in September 2012, and the clothes will hit stores in January of 2013. Threading the tulle loom takes two months and two people, says Ms. Lescroart. \"\"Tell the designers that's why it takes so long to fill their orders,\"\" she jokes. In another room, women mend tiny faults by hand, holding the lace on their laps. \"\"This is a woman's room,\"\" says Ms. Lescroart. \"\"It takes patience.\"\" Down a hallway in a laboratory, chemist Philippe Desmaretz measures dyes in beakers and vials. \"\"He's got a lot of work now because of the shows,\"\" Ms. Lescroart says. \"\"All the designers want special colors.\"\" \u2014Contact me at Christina.Binkley@wsj.com or twitter.com/BinkleyOnStyle.

Sale strengthens automaker's cash, boosts balance sheet David Shepardson and Christina Rogers / The Detroit News General Motors Co. has sold its ownership stake in Delphi Automotive LLP to bolster cash and fortify its balance sheet. The Detroit automaker said Thursday the sale was valued at $3.8 billion. GM, which spun off Delphi as a separate company in 1999, reacquired partial ownership of in the Troy-based supplier in October 2009 as it exited bankruptcy as a new firm owned mostly by former creditors. Delphi filed for bankruptcy in 2005. \"\"We are systematically delivering on our commitment to strengthen and simplify our balance sheet,\"\" said Dan Ammann, who officially becomes GM's senior vice president and chief financial officer today. The sale ends a painful period for GM, which had sought to end its ties with Delphi, only to be forced to reacquire its global steering business in 2009.

GM will report $1.6 billion in revenue from the sale in the first quarter of 2011. While GM will eventually earn $3.8 billion on the sale, it previously spent $12.5 billion to help the supplier during its bankruptcy stay.

Former New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) Officer David Warren was sentenced today in connection with the post-Katrina shooting death of Henry Glover, and current NOPD Officer Greg McRae was sentenced for the subsequent burning of Glover's remains and obstruction of justice. Former NOPD Officer Warren was sentenced to 25 years and nine months in prison for his involvement in the Sept. 2, 2005, shooting death of civilian Henry Glover. As part of the restitution order, Warren will also pay $7,642.32 to Glover's family for funeral expenses. Warren was found guilty by a federal jury of a civil rights violation resulting in death for shooting Glover, and for using a firearm to commit manslaughter. Current NOPD Officer McRae was sentenced to 17 years and three months in prison, three years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $6,000 for his involvement in the burning of Mr. Glover's body. McRae was convicted of two civil rights violations, one count of obstructing justice, and one count of using fire during the commission of a felony. One of the civil rights counts charged that McRae willfully used fire to destroy a civilian's property by burning and destroying a car, and the other civil rights count charged that he willfully deprived Glover's family members of their right to seek redress in the courts for his death. Evidence presented at trial established that Warren, while stationed on a second floor lookout, shot Glover, who was a floor below him and running away. Glover's brother and a friend flagged down a passing motorist, \"\"Good Samaritan\"\" William Tanner, who put the wounded Glover in his car to try to get medical attention for him.

Technology can be used with existing cars Hydrogen is clean alternative to petrol and produces only water when burned Hydrogen fuel could be set to become a viable environmentally friendly alternative to petrol following the development of new technology that allows the natural gas to be stored in a cheap and practical way. The groundbreaking technique utilises materials that soak up hydrogen like a sponge, and then encapsulates them in tiny plastic beads so small they behave like a liquid. The process, based on a new way of producing nano-fibres from hydrides, is being developed by Cella Energy, a spin-off from Britain's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The technique allows hydrogen to be released at a much faster rate and at lower temperatures than before, researchers said. \"\"What we've been doing is taking these materials and encasing them in plastic and making them into a very fine powder and that improves their properties,\"\" Cella Energy Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Bennington said. \"\"It also means you can pump it like a fluid and it's safe. It is not gong to easily burst into flames,\"\" he said. Hydrogen produces only water when it is burned and is considered an ideal solution to cutting carbon emissions from petrol or diesel vehicles, which are estimated to cause 25 per cent of all carbon release. But until now, attempts to store hydrogen have not been consumer-friendly so this has not been a viable option. Cella Energy Ltd say their technology would allow people to use the carbon-free fuel with their existing car after a few modifications. \"\"You would pump it into your petrol tank of your car - that would go off, be heated, drive the hydrogen off, which would go and run your vehicle and then the waste little beads that we have created you store in the car. And when you go and refuel your car you have two nozzles. One which puts in the new beads and one which takes out the old beads which goes off to be recycled and the hydrogen added to it again,\"\" Bennington said. The development has been to turn hydrides into fibres or beads, 30 times smaller than a human hair, through a process of electro-spinning. This produces a white tissue-like material that can be controlled to capture and release hydrogen. The encapsulation process protects the hydrides from oxygen and water, prolonging their life and making it possible to handle them safely in air and because it behaves like a liquid, current infrastructure will need minimal modification. \"\"You can use tankers to carry the material around,\"\" said Bennington. \"\"You can take it to forecourts and then you can pump it into the vehicle and give the customer the same kind of experience they have now.\"\" All part of the reason Cella Energy believe their process could herald a new era of carbon-free motoring. \"\"The experience that most people have now is using regular liquid fuels where it takes three minutes to fill your vehicle and then you can travel 300 miles,\"\" said Stephen Voller, Cella Energy's CEO. \"\"Now you can have exactly the same experience with hydrogen but you can't have that experience with an electric car.\"\" The company said hydrogen could be an economically viable alternative to fossil fuels if the gas is produced with renewable energy sources like wind or solar. It has three times more energy than petrol per unit of weight and could power cars, planes and other vehicles that currently use hydrocarbons. It said it is also attracting interest from large established companies in the energy and transportation sectors.", "sports-20933032": "Ka'aihue Homer Powers Kansas City Past Angels 2-1. KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Kila Ka'aihue hit Michael Kohn's second pitch of the ninth inning for a game-ending home run, lifting the Kansas City Royals to a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night. Kohn (0-1) relieved Jordan Walden to start the ninth and was ahead 0-1 in the count when Ka'aihue, who had struck out twice, slammed the ball 393 feet over the fence in right. Joakim Soria (1-0) pitched the ninth for Kansas City. The Royals tied it 1-all in the fourth on an infield out by Jeff Francoeur after Billy Butler singled and moved up on a hit and a wild pitch. Howie Kendrick gave the Angels a 1-0 lead on the eighth pitch that starter Jeff Francis threw as a Royal, swatting the full-count delivery over the fence in center for a 418-foot home run. But that was all the Angels would get off Francis, a 30-year-old who is still trying to make a full comeback from left shoulder surgery that sidelined him the entire 2009 season and part of 2010. The Angels had at least one base runner in five of the next six innings but could not break through against the 6-foot-5 left-hander, stranding runners in scoring position in the second, third and fifth. Starters Dan Haren of the Angels and Francis both went seven impressive innings, allowing only one run and six hits. Haren, going for his fourth win in his last five starts in Kansas City, hurt himself with a wild pitch that helped the Royals score their lone run off him. He had six strikeouts and no walks. Francis, who signed as a free agent from Colorado, gave up five hits and one run, walking one and striking out four. Vernon Wells made a great catch to stop the Royals from taking the lead in the sixth. Alex Gordon doubled leading off, went to third on Butler's groundball and was there with two outs when Francoeur hit a line drive into deep left. Wells went back and made a leaping catch almost at the wall. The Royals also stranded a runner at third in the third, fifth and eighth. Mike Aviles tripled with two outs in the third but Haren struck out Melky Cabrera. In the fifth, Brayan Pena doubled leading off and was at third when Aviles popped up and Cabrera flied out. Aviles walked leading off the eighth against reliever Walden and went to third with two outs when he stole second and kept going on catcher Jeff Mathis' throwing error. But Walden struck out Butler. NOTES: Angels are opening season at Kansas City for the first time. ... According to Angels' research, Mathis was only third man in major league history to hit an opening day home run on his birthday. ... With a payroll of $36,126,000 and an opening day average age of 27.21, Royals are youngest and poorest team in the majors.", "sports-20932674": "Jimenez Doesn't Have His Usual Stuff. DENVER (AP) \u2014 Ubaldo Jimenez has six different pitches to befuddle batters. On Friday, he couldn't find the proper spin on his breaking balls or enough zip on his heaters. It added up to a terrible 2011 debut for the Colorado Rockies ace who started out 15-1 last season. Jimenez looked like he was throwing batting practice Friday, laboring through six innings, allowing six runs \u2014 five earned \u2014 on seven hits and a wild pitch in a 7-6, 11-inning loss to Arizona at Coors Field. He was long gone by the time Matt Lindstrom's wild pitch with one out in the top of the 11th inning allowed Gerardo Parra to score from third base with the go-ahead run. All but one of the hits he allowed went for extra bases, including home runs by Justin Upton and Miguel Montero. Knowing he lacked his usual breaking stuff, he stuck with fastballs, but his heaters were topping out at 93 mph instead of the usual 99-100. \"\"If I have the speed that I normally do, it's not easy to hit it even if they know that I'm going to be throwing fastball every time,\"\" Jimenez said. \"\"But I didn't have the movement, I didn't have the speed.\"\" After averaging 8.7 strikeouts per nine innings last year, Colorado's ace whiffed just one batter. His unusual futility finally caught up to him in the fifth, when Upton's three-run homer put Arizona ahead 4-3. \"\"It wasn't as electric,\"\" Upton said of Jimenez's repertoire. \"\"I don't know exactly what he was throwing but it wasn't jumping like it usually does.\"\" Jimenez said he couldn't locate his curveball in the bullpen warming up and had to stick with fastballs. \"\"That's the only thing I had,\"\" he said. And without the usual oomph, he didn't even have that. In the sixth, Montero collected his fifth career hit \u2014 and third career homer \u2014 off Jimenez, sending a 2-1 pitch into the bullpen in right-center to give the Diamondbacks a 6-3 cushion. \"\"It's kind of weird. To be honest, I don't think he was throwing that hard,\"\" Montero said. \"\"Today he didn't have the greatest stuff, he wasn't throwing near as hard as (normal) and we were able to take advantage.\"\" Jimenez, last year's NL All-Star Game starter, walked away with a 7.50 ERA. Jimenez felt worst, however, about walking pitcher Ian Kennedy in the fifth before allowing a single to Willie Bloomquist, who started at shortstop with Stephen Drew held out of the lineup as he recovers from a strained abdominal muscle. One out later, Upton's three-run shot put Arizona ahead. \"\"That's what hurt me the most,\"\" Jimenez said. \"\"You never want to be walking the pitcher. Every time that happens, it's going to get in your head and always there's a problem that's going to come after that.\"\" The last time Jimenez struck out just one batter was on May 21, 2008, against San Francisco, when he tossed seven innings in a no-decision. Jimenez said he felt fine physically and wasn't worried that this bad outing was more than a one-time deal, and his teammates brushed off their ace's unusually poor performance. \"\"He can be nervous, too. He's allowed that,\"\" Todd Helton said. \"\"His stuff looked good.

(Adds comments from press conference in sixth paragraph.) March 31 (Bloomberg) - Hennes & Mauritz AB, the world\u2019s second-largest clothing retailer, reported first-quarter profit that fell more than analysts anticipated as the company decided against passing on higher costs to customers. Net income dropped 30 percent to 2.62 billion kronor ($420 million) in the quarter ended Feb. 28 from 3.74 billion kronor from the year-earlier period, the Stockholm-based company said in a statement today. The average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 2.77 billion kronor. The shares fell as much as 4.4 percent. H&M\u2019s sales dropped 1 percent in the period while larger rival Inditex SA posted a 10 percent jump in its fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. H&M, which buys its products from about 700 suppliers, has reduced prices for some items even as the price of cotton has traded near a record while some competitors have raised or maintained them. \u201cH&M is making a massive bet on market-share gains,\u201d Simon Irwin, an analyst at Liberum Capital in London, said by phone today. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting prices in an environment where their costs are rising and competition is increasing.\u201d H&M shares fell as much as 9.5 kronor to 207.10 kronor and traded at 208.40 kronor as of 12:01 p.m. The stock has dropped 6.9 percent this year, compared with larger rival Inditex\u2019s 0.7 percent advance. Inditex runs Zara stores. The Swedish retailer\u2019s strategy to not pass on increased sourcing costs has served it well and the strategy is \u201cgood in the longer term,\u201d H&M Chief Executive Officer Karl-Johan Persson said at a press conference today. Trench Coat H&M sells a trench coat on its U.K. Website for 34.99 pounds ($56.44), while Zara offers one for 79.99 pounds. Inditex, which also runs Massimo Dutti and Bershka stores, gets about 65 percent of its revenue from Zara. H&M sources two-thirds of its product from Asia. Inditex gets about 35 percent of its products from there and only half of that amount comes from China, where input costs are rising the fastest, said London-based Societe Generale analyst Anne Critchlow in an e-mail. \u201cH&M has chosen to reduce its prices in the current environment, which further hurts the gross margin,\u201d said Critchlow, who has a sell rating on the stock. \u201cInditex says its prices are maintained.\u201d H&M\u2019s gross margin in the first quarter was 57.8 percent, compared with 61.9 percent a year earlier. Sales in February rose by 9 percent in local currencies from the same month last year and advanced 3 percent between March 1 and March 29. \u2018More Robust\u2019 \u201cInditex is much better-placed\u201d than H&M, said Irwin. \u201cIts top-line has been more robust, and given its mid-market positioning and proximity sourcing base it is less exposed to rising input prices.\u201d H&M also said today that the three months was \u201ccharacterized by continued restrained consumption, a discount- driven market with many price activities and unfavourable weather conditions,\u201d in December when it closed some stores temporarily amid heavy snowstorms. \u201cSales have remained sluggish, which we think will raise concerns that H&M is confusing customers and pricing too close to discounters,\u201d said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Richard Chamberlain in a note today. Inditex also plans to expand at about twice the pace of H&M, with a target of 500 new stores this year while H&M aims for 250. Inditex said on March 23 that it opened 160 stores in Asia last year, of which 75 were in China\u2019s main and smaller cities.

Long-running feud between country and internet company flares up again as Beijing alleges tax violations by subsidiaries Chinese authorities have found three companies linked to Google Inc broke tax rules and are investigating possible tax avoidance, a state-run newspaper said on Thursday, raising the risk of renewed pressure on the internet search giant. Google said two of the companies named were its units, and a third was a separate firm that works closely with Google. But Google denied the tax violations alleged in the Chinese-language Economic Daily. \"\"We believe we are, and always have been, in full compliance with Chinese tax law,\"\" Google said in a statement. Even if the report is unfounded or embellished, it could bring fresh headaches in China for Google, which has gone through difficult times there since early last year when it clashed with the government over internet censorship and hacking attacks. China generates a small percentage of Google's revenues, but is the world's largest internet market with more than 450 million users. The country's search market, dominated by homegrown Baidu Inc, was worth 11bn yuan (\u00a31.05bn) in 2010 and is likely to grow by about 50% each year for the next four years, according to iResearch. The Economic Daily said that the three companies investigated and punished were \"\"Google enterprises in China\"\". \"\"The taxation authorities have already investigated and punished the three companies according to the law,\"\" said the report on its front page. The companies were accused of presenting false and unjustified claims to the total value of 40m yuan, said the report. It did not say when the claimed violations are alleged to have happened. \"\"It is understood by this reporter that the taxation authorities are further investigating Google businesses in China on suspicion of tax avoidance,\"\" said the brief story, which was also later reported by China's official Xinhua news agency. A Google spokesperson said the two of the accused companies - Google Information Technology (China) Co Ltd and and Google Information Technology (Shanghai) Co Ltd - were its sub-units. It said the third company named, Google Advertising (Shanghai) Co Ltd, was a separate firm which works \"\"closely with Google as Google's sole first-tier reseller in China\"\" of advertising on the search engine's web pages. \"\"Most foreign companies in China, especially high-profile companies with a global reputation at stake, are pretty careful to make sure they are in full compliance with the relevant tax laws,\"\" said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based company that advises investors about China's Internet and telecommunications sectors. China's foreign ministry would not comment directly about the report. \"\"Generally speaking, any companies operating abroad should obey the laws and regulations of the host country,\"\" said the ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. The report appeared after Google again clashed with the Chinese government over internet censorship. Earlier this month, Google said any difficulty that users in China may have faced opening its email service were likely the result of government blocks. China's ruling Communist party has intensified censorship in recent months, fearing that calls for protests inspired by anti-authoritarian uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa could gather momentum. Google's serious run-ins with the Chinese government began in January 2010, when the company said it was no longer willing to censor search results in the country.

Likelihood that radiotherapy will cause another tumor is low, researchers say TUESDAY, March 29 (HealthDay News) - The odds a second cancer will develop after radiation treatment for a first cancer are relatively low, U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers report. In a long-term study of more than 600,000 cancer survivors, an estimated 8 percent of second cancers were attributable to radiation treatment for the original cancer, according to the study. The results suggest that other factors, such as lifestyle risks and genetics, cause the majority of second cancers, the researchers say. \"\"The findings can be used by physicians to really put the risks into perspective when they are talking treatment options with their patients,\"\" said lead researcher Amy Berrington de Gonzalez, an investigator in the NCI's radiation epidemiology branch. Patients should feel reassured, she added. \"\"In general, the risks [of radiation therapy] are smaller than the benefits,\"\" she said. The study, published online March 30 in The Lancet Oncology , is the first to quantify the cancer risks posed by radiation treatment for different malignancies. Berrington de Gonzalez and colleagues collected data on 647,672 adult cancer survivors included in the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registries. All had survived five years or longer after cancer treatment, and follow-up ran from 1978 to 2007. The researchers looked at outcomes for 15 different types of cancer for which radiation treatment is routine, including cancers of the rectum, larynx, lung, breast, cervix, testicles, prostate, eye and orbit, brain and thyroid. Over the 30 years of follow-up, 9 percent of these participants developed a second cancer. Of these, about 3,300 (8 percent) might have been the result of radiation treatment, the study authors said. Second cancers related to earlier radiation therapy varied by type, the researchers noted. More than half of the second cancers developed in breast and prostate cancer survivors. Four percent of second cancers were in the eye, and 24 percent were cancer of the testicles, the researchers found. Patients who had their initial cancer when young were at the greatest risk of developing a second cancer. Also at high risk were those whose organs received high doses of radiation. The likelihood of developing a secondary cancer increased over time. When these data are put in perspective, the absolute risk for a second cancer is 3 in 1,000 over 10 years after radiation therapy and 5 in 1,000 over 15 years, Berrington de Gonzalez said. \"\"We know that radiation therapy can increase the risk of getting another cancer, but at the same time the benefits outweigh the risks,\"\" said Elizabeth Ward, national vice president for intramural research at the American Cancer Society. Radiation therapy is an important and relatively safe treatment for cancer, she added. Thanks to treatment advances, Ward said, radiologists today are better able to pinpoint treatment and limit exposure to healthy tissue than they were in the past. Now, studies are needed to determine the cancer risks from newer radiation treatments, the authors noted. Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, agreed that the NCI findings are encouraging. \"\"Despite people's concerns, radiation is relatively safe with regard to the issue of second cancers, because the number of cancers that result from it are very small,\"\" D'Amico said.

The design's secret is the illusion of instant weight-loss, helping to shape the body in the same way as Spanx control tights and lingerie. \"\"The challenge was to use data to create a suit that accentuates the good bits, and smooths the lumpy bits without making women feel like they're wrapped in cling-film,\"\" the Daily Express quoted Debenhams swimwear buyer Sasha Nagalingham as saying. The suit's inner layer is made from a specially-designed heavier gauge lining fabric which does the miracle work, while the outer layer is a slinky micro-fibre. Low-rise legs ensure no bulges and a smooth curve in the hip. Moulded bust supports lift and separate in a similar way to a bra. It is sized by cup fitting as well as dress to make a perfect fit. Extra strength through the waist panel creates an cinching effect and a control panel simultaneously flattens the tummy.", "business-20891485": "Google faces tax investigation by China. Long-running feud between country and internet company flares up again as Beijing alleges tax violations by subsidiaries Chinese authorities have found three companies linked to Google Inc broke tax rules and are investigating possible tax avoidance, a state-run newspaper said on Thursday, raising the risk of renewed pressure on the internet search giant. Google said two of the companies named were its units, and a third was a separate firm that works closely with Google. But Google denied the tax violations alleged in the Chinese-language Economic Daily. \"\"We believe we are, and always have been, in full compliance with Chinese tax law,\"\" Google said in a statement. Even if the report is unfounded or embellished, it could bring fresh headaches in China for Google, which has gone through difficult times there since early last year when it clashed with the government over internet censorship and hacking attacks. China generates a small percentage of Google's revenues, but is the world's largest internet market with more than 450 million users. The country's search market, dominated by homegrown Baidu Inc, was worth 11bn yuan (\u00a31.05bn) in 2010 and is likely to grow by about 50% each year for the next four years, according to iResearch. The Economic Daily said that the three companies investigated and punished were \"\"Google enterprises in China\"\". \"\"The taxation authorities have already investigated and punished the three companies according to the law,\"\" said the report on its front page. The companies were accused of presenting false and unjustified claims to the total value of 40m yuan, said the report. It did not say when the claimed violations are alleged to have happened. \"\"It is understood by this reporter that the taxation authorities are further investigating Google businesses in China on suspicion of tax avoidance,\"\" said the brief story, which was also later reported by China's official Xinhua news agency. A Google spokesperson said the two of the accused companies - Google Information Technology (China) Co Ltd and and Google Information Technology (Shanghai) Co Ltd - were its sub-units. It said the third company named, Google Advertising (Shanghai) Co Ltd, was a separate firm which works \"\"closely with Google as Google's sole first-tier reseller in China\"\" of advertising on the search engine's web pages. \"\"Most foreign companies in China, especially high-profile companies with a global reputation at stake, are pretty careful to make sure they are in full compliance with the relevant tax laws,\"\" said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based company that advises investors about China's Internet and telecommunications sectors. China's foreign ministry would not comment directly about the report. \"\"Generally speaking, any companies operating abroad should obey the laws and regulations of the host country,\"\" said the ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. The report appeared after Google again clashed with the Chinese government over internet censorship. Earlier this month, Google said any difficulty that users in China may have faced opening its email service were likely the result of government blocks. China's ruling Communist party has intensified censorship in recent months, fearing that calls for protests inspired by anti-authoritarian uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa could gather momentum. Google's serious run-ins with the Chinese government began in January 2010, when the company said it was no longer willing to censor search results in the country. Previously, the company included a disclaimer on its China service that searches may not be complete because of local laws.", "health-20876242": "Retiree health cost estimate falls, for a change. BOSTON - Rising health care costs are a given. But for the first time in 10 years, the outlook is improving for new retirees wondering whether they'll be able to pay their medical bills throughout their retirements. A 65-year-old couple retiring this year will need $230,000, on average, to cover medical expenses in retirement, according to a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments. That's down 8 percent from the $250,000 projection the Boston-based financial services company made a year ago. That's notable because the total had risen each year since Fidelity made its initial calculation of $160,000 in 2002. Annual increases have averaged 6 percent. Fidelity attributes its optimism to President Obama's year-old health care overhaul, which will reduce many seniors' out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs. The projections are part of Fidelity's business helping employers design workplace benefits programs. The study is based on projections for a couple of 65-year-olds retiring this year with Medicare coverage. The estimate factors in the federal program's premiums, co-payments and deductibles, as well as out-of-pocket prescription costs. The study assumes no employer provided insurance in retirement, and a life expectancy of 85 for women and 82 for men. The calculation was complicated this year by the health care bill that Obama signed into law in March 2010. Although its focus is expanding health care access to people under age 65, the law also will benefit many retirees by gradually closing what's known as the \"\"doughnut hole\"\" coverage gap in the Medicare drug benefit. Fidelity says that's the key reason why its projection is down this year. But that effect will run its course. Longer-term, retirees' cost savings aren't expected to offset other factors driving expenses up, such as new medical technologies, greater use of health care services, and more diagnostic tests. That's why Fidelity expects its calculation will eventually resume its historic pattern of annual increases. \"\"We expect that trend to continue when we look to 2012 and beyond,\"\" said Sunit Patel, a senior vice president for benefits consulting at Fidelity. Fidelity's estimate is a projection of what an average couple would need. Actual costs will vary widely, depending on a couple's medical needs and how long they live. The projection also doesn't factor in most dental services, or long-term care, such as costs from living in a nursing home. In any given year, about one in four Medicare beneficiaries have drug expenses high enough to hit the doughnut hole, in which they're responsible for the full cost of their medications. The older one gets, the greater the chances of landing in that hole at some point because of an illness requiring costly prescription drugs. For 2011, the coverage gap starts after Medicare beneficiaries and their insurance plan have spent $2,840 on medications. After that, seniors are responsible for roughly the next $3,600. Once total spending reaches about $6,440, Medicare's catastrophic coverage kicks in and beneficiaries pay only a small amount. Under the new law, the gap will be gradually eliminated by 2020. When the changes are complete, seniors will just pay the regular 25 percent cost sharing for all their medications. The Employee Benefit Research Institute, an independent nonprofit, conducts similar research but, unlike Fidelity, doesn't focus on an average. That's because there are so many variables that impact a retiree's circumstances, says Paul Fronstin, EBRI's director of health research and education. In its latest annual estimate released in November, EBRI projected that a couple with median drug expenses - meaning half of the population would have higher, and half lower - would need $158,000 for a 50 percent chance of having saved enough to cover health care expenses in retirement. They'd need $271,000 for a 90 percent chance. EBRI's study didn't closely examine the savings impact from the health care law because of differences in how it makes its projections compared with Fidelity.

LOS ANGELES - California workplace safety officials have fined Larry Flynt's Hustler Video and another porn producer for not using condoms on set to protect sex performers from exposure to disease. Hustler faces $14,175 in fines for three violations, including failure to provide condoms or other protective equipment, according to a Division of Occupational Safety and Health citation provided to The Associated Press Wednesday. Hustler \"\"failed to ensure the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, such as condoms\"\" to protect its employees from semen, vaginal excretions and blood in the course of producing adult videos, according to the citation. The current fines are based on the same section of state law that also requires hospitals to provide nurses with protective gear to spare them exposure to blood-borne and fluid-borne illnesses. Flynt has said in the past that audiences don't want to watch porn in which actors use condoms. Hustler was also fined for failing to maintain a written injury and illness policies and for failing to provide workers with vaccines for hepatitis C. Hustler's citation stems from a Sept. 14 inspection of a jobs site in response to a complaint from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that advocates for safe sex in pornography. Forsaken Pictures faces $12,150 in fines for similar violations. The fines were issued March 9. Cal/OSHA Senior Safety Engineer Deborah Gold said the state continually investigates the porn industry, though job sites can be difficult to find, and has cited a handful of producers for violations in recent years. \"\"Clearly if an employee is having unprotected sexual contact with another person then there needs to be either engineering control, like simulation, or people need to use a condom or other barrier,\"\" Gold said. A telephone message seeking comment left by The Associated Press wasn't immediately returned by a Hustler representative. Contact information for Forsaken couldn't be located. Late last year, a porn actor tested positive for HIV at a California clinic, causing panic among actors.

ARLINGTON, Texas\u2014David Murphy ran to first base looking out toward the left-field corner and expecting the ball to drop in foul territory. Except his slicing liner kicked up chalk for the Texas Rangers. Like so many times while winning their first American League championship a year ago, the Rangers pulled off an exhilarating comeback. \"\"There isn't anything changed with those guys,\"\" manager Ron Washington said after a 9-5 win Friday over the Boston Red Sox in the season opener. Pinch-hitter Murphy's tiebreaking, two-run double off hard-throwing Daniel Bard was part of a four-run outburst in the eighth for Texas, which before the game raised the AL championship flag. \"\"My body language brought it back in. I was praying the ball would hit the chalk, and it did,\"\" Washington said. \"\"When it hit the chalk, I lost it.\"\" Rangers newcomers Mike Napoli and Yorvit Torrealba ran home to break a 5-all tie. Murphy scored on a double by Elvis Andrus before another double by AL MVP Josh Hamilton. Napoli, Ian Kinsler and Nelson Cruz all homered for the Rangers, whose opener came exactly five months after a Game 5 loss to San Francisco at home ended its first World Series. The reloaded Red Sox, who added All-Stars Adrian Gonzalez and Carl Crawford after missing the playoffs last season, blew leads of 2-0 and 4-2. \"\"Every loss is frustrating. We've got 161 to go,\"\" Kevin Youkilis said. \"\"We know we're better than we played today. There's going to be a lot of games like that this year, but hopefully not too many in a row.\"\" Murphy pinch-hit for No. 9 batter Julio Borbon, the center fielder whose two-base error on the first play of the game led to the Red Sox scoring a pair of unearned runs. Borbon remained a starter even after five errors in 21 spring training games, a move that allows the Rangers to play Hamilton in left but relegates Murphy to the bench. \"\"I do it for my teammates. I love my teammates,\"\" said Murphy, who started 105 games last season. \"\"Would I like to be included more? Yes. But if I continue to hit, I don't think I should have a problem.\"\" Bard said he made the exact pitch he wanted to Murphy. \"\"Sinker down and away. It was on the knees, outer black,\"\" Bard said. \"\"He just barely got the bat to it. Three inches to the left and that's a foul ball, and we're having a different conversation.\"\" Darren Oliver, the third Texas reliever, got the victory even after allowing a homer to David Ortiz in the top of the eighth that tied it at 5. Gonzalez had two hits and drove in three runs in his Boston debut. Crawford went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts while leaving a runner in scoring position each at-bat.", "fashion-20841639": "Jean Paul Gaultier's talking head. For a unique take on the world of fashion, sign up to the Guardian's fashion email FASHION DILEMMA What to make of Gaultier's talking head? We're constantly on the lookout for weird and wonderful stories in the the weird and wonderful world of fashion, so our patent-pending Weirdar gave a resounding \"\"beep!\"\" when we heard the news that Jean Paul Gaultier is to be the subject of an exhibition in Canada. What's so weird about that, you ask? Well, he's also going to be part of an experiment to turn him into a talking head. Pencils out ... aaaand tick the \"\"weird\"\" box! Before you get too excited, FS must break the news that this is, alas, not some sort of twisted real-life version of that comedy classic The Man with Two Brains, or indeed, as a quick Twitter inquiry for \"\"films with talking heads\"\" reminded us, a re-make of the scene in Return to Oz where Dorothy steals the powder of life from Princess Mombi (watch it - it's scary). We must turn to the new exhibition, \"\"The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier: From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk\"\", to find out what's really going on. \"\"We moulded the head of Jean Paul in plaster and we will have [film] projections right onto the face,\"\" explains Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the curator of the exhibition. Oh. FS is disappointed. However, we reckon the exhibition will be fun even without decapitation. There will be 120 iconic outfits on display and a variety of talking plaster heads modelled on Gaultier's celebrity clients (what will the Kate Moss one say?). They'll also show some of Gaultier's early fashion sketches, Polaroids by Andy Warhol, and incontrovertible proof that JPG was a child prodigy. This comes in the form of an augmented teddy bear upon which the young designer affixed a crafted paper pointy bosom. We can't wait. The exhibition opens at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Montr\u00e9al in Canada on June 17. BANG ON TREND Whistles' \"\"Carrie\"\" skirt, New Look's purple pumps, and Dorothy Perkins' orange dress/ Colour blocking Tangerine, lime and lemon. No, FS is not suffering from scurvy, we're talking about fashionable colours. Bright, bold colour blocking is one of the trends we have deemed to be \"\"actual fun\"\" and there's no need to stick to citrus. Mix and (mis)match scarlet, violet, and sky-blue, too. One of the nice things about colour blocking is that it's quite easy to do and you can take it as far as you want. If you're just after a shot of colour to add va-va-voom to a plain outfit then there are plenty of great accessories at the moment. Take, for instance, Asos's hot pink clutch (currently \u00a316) which would look great matched with an orange dress like this one from Dorothy Perkins (\u00a335). French Connection's cross-body bag is satchel-like, gorgeous and a sunny shade of tangerine (\u00a3165), and on the other end of the price scale we've found a blue skinny belt for a mere \u00a34 from fashionunion.co.uk. If you're after shoes then purple brogues will help to brighten your day - these Asos suede ones are fabulous (\u00a335). Need shoes for a jazzier occasion? Then try New Look's purple court shoe with a platform sole (\u00a319.99). Alternatively, River Island are stocking a nice line in red and yellow patent slingbacks with a kitten heel (\u00a339.99). Skirt-wearers should watch out for spring's new maxi lengths - they're perfect for colour blocking. Reiss's \"\"Danielle\"\" version costs \u00a3100 (ouch) and is suitably voluminous whether you buy it in green or vermillion. Then there's the infamous (and rapidly becoming ubiquitous) coral \"\"Carrie\"\" pleated skirt from Whistles. At \u00a395 it's what Grazia would call an investment piece (or FS would call expensive) and you might want to try out wearing the new lengths (knee-length and midi) before you decide it's for you. Zara have some great trousers available in a rainbow of colours from apple green to acid yellow. They're all around the \u00a340 mark and we'll just provide you with a link to the skinny pair as we particularly like the way they're styled in the model's picture.

WASHINGTON Prosecutors investigating former Sen. John Edwards spent several hours Thursday re-interviewing the man who posed as the father of Edwards' out-of-wedlock baby during the 2008 presidential campaign. Andrew Young met with the prosecutors in his attorney's Washington office for more than four hours. The Associated Press spotted him leaving the building's underground garage in a vehicle with a North Carolina license plate registered to his wife, Cheri, at their home in Chapel Hill. The interview is particularly notable because of its timing. Young has already been questioned by a grand jury investigating Edwards in 2009, and the Justice Department is considering whether to move forward with an indictment. The prosecutors could be interested in taking a closer look at Young to see how he'll hold up as a witness, since his credibility could be problematic. Young, who was an aide to Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign, initially claimed he was the father of the child and traveled around the country helping keep Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, hidden. Young has since come out with a book detailing his role in covering up Edwards' paternity of the baby. Young now says he made a mistake in judgment by lying. His book is being turned into a Hollywood film. Edwards acknowledged in January 2010 that he fathered the girl, Frances Quinn Hunter. Last year, a North Carolina judge said he was troubled by a series of seemingly conflicting statements that Young made under oath in a lawsuit over a purported sex tape depicting Edwards. Superior Court Judge Abraham Penn Jones considered sending Young to jail for contempt but backed away as Young's attorneys argued that the discrepancies were memory lapses. Young has said he had the sex tape simply to corroborate his story. Young's attorney, David Geneson, did not return a call for comment on the meeting, and the Justice Department declined to comment. The investigation centers on the money spent to keep Hunter and Young in hiding. Investigators are looking chiefly at whether money paid to Hunter and Young - from outside political groups and Edwards' political donors - should have been considered campaign donations since the money arguably aided his presidential bid. Young would be the chief witness, since one donor who gave them money has died and the second is 100 years old. Haunted by other case The investigation is being jointly run by the Republican-appointed U.S. attorney in Raleigh and the public integrity section of Justice Department in Washington. The Justice Department has reason to be cautious in pursuing the case after the public integrity section's last prosecution of a high-profile politician, the late Alaska Republican Sen.

Considering the number of ethical dilemmas raised in the Danish melodrama In A Better World , I wish I could say I'd been left with more questions rattling around in my head than \"\"What on earth were the Oscar voters thinking?\"\" Taking home the trophy for Best Foreign Language Film will certainly help Susanne Bier's earnest treatise on the evil cycle of violence and retribution find an audience at art houses. And there's a lot to be said for a well-acted, attractively shot drama that has its heart so firmly in the right place. But after a few queasy moments at its midpoint, the trajectory of In a Better World becomes so relentlessly platitudinous that an audience that ought to feel seriously rattled will be settling back, feeling comfortably reassured. That's not true early on, as Bier cuts between Anton (Mikael Persbrandt), a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation, and his put-upon adolescent son Elias (Markus Rygaard), who's at home and being tormented in his father's absence by a school bully. Elias finds an ally when Christian (William Johnk Nielsen) joins the class - a well-spoken, polite kid whose anger at his mother's recent death (from cancer) needs an outlet. Christian's philosophy about dealing with bullies, which is basically that if you hit back hard enough the first time, you won't need to hit back again, isn't one that school authorities would likely approve. But it changes the dynamics of Elias' life pretty quickly. It also has predictably dire repercussions when the boys decide to apply it to other conflicts. Papa Anton, meanwhile, is confronted with ethical dilemmas of his own when Big Man, a brutal local warlord whose savagery keeps Anton's operating table full, comes in with a life-threatening wound. From there Bier whips absent parents, pipe bombs, the Hippocratic oath, marital infidelity, impotent authority figures and other ingredients into a potent melodramatic brew that poses but doesn't answer such questions as whether violence is sometimes necessary or always a poisoner of souls, and whether turning the other cheek establishes moral authority or destabilizes social order. Contrasting warm African golds with chilly Danish greens, the director matches striking visuals with overtly melodramatic situations - children with access to rooftops and fireworks to get your protective juices flowing, predators so unsubtle their comeuppance seems a foregone conclusion. Bier creates some genuinely disturbing moments - a scene in which Anton allows a bullying father to strike him again and again in front of the kids, a harrowing exchange with Big Man as the thug begins to heal - but resolves them in ways that allow the audience, if not her protagonists, to shrug off moral consequences. There's sufficient craft that you go along with the twists, even as Bier is wrapping things up with a neatly tied bow. But in a better world, In a Better World would be a better movie.", "fashion-20837495": "Kate Moss back in the hologram dress as she pays tribute to Alexander McQueen in magazine shoot. She was left devastated by her friend Alexander McQueen's suicide a year ago. But Kate Moss has decided to pay tribute to the late designer the best way she knows how - by wearing one of his most iconic creations. The 37-year-old poses in McQueen's ethereal \"\"hologram\"\" organza dress, which she famously wore for his Autumn/Winter 2006 fashion show five years ago, for a new magazine shoot. Enlarge A hologram of Moss flailing around like a ghostly apparition appeared on stage at the climax of the March 2006 show at Paris Fashion Week. McQueen projected the image on the stage in tribute to Moss, who was then lying low after being caught in a cocaine scandal six months earlier. And the supermodel was given the chance to return the favour in the new issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine. On the cover of the glossy, Moss also wears a white McQueen creation by the label's head designer Sarah Burton, who took over from Lee McQueen after his death. Of the late designer, who committed suicide in February last year, Kate says: \"\"There\u2019s never ever going to be anybody like him. She recalls first meeting McQueen. \u2018It was all a bit of a blur - I was doing a lot of shows at the time. \"\"I can\u2019t even remember the first show I did for him, but I remember the first show he did in New York. It was raining, everyone was outside, and I said, \u201cLee, you\u2019ve got to get Anna Wintour in!\u201d He didn\u2019t care. It was all chaos.\u2019 \"\"His was the most exciting show to see ever, even if you weren\u2019t there. I would hear about it on the phone and hear Lee and hear everyone. \"\"There was so much tension, but we had the best laughs. He was a dear friend of mine. I miss him terribly.\"\" Kate discusses clothes the late designer gave her during their friendship in the interview. \u2018There are a few he gave me before he died,\"\" she says. \"\"I went to give him his Christmas present and he gave me a lot of stuff. He was saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have this.\u201d \"\"He gave me a black dress and a fur that I wore to his funeral. Before the funeral, I was going through my wardrobe thinking, \u201cWhat am I going to wear?\u201d It\u2019s weird, now that I think about it - almost like he kind of knew.\u2019 The man dubbed the wild child of British fashion, \"\"gave women power\"\", the supermodel insists, \"\"while letting them be fragile and vulnerable at the same time. \"\"People always used to say he was a misogynist, but it took me a while to realise that he was actually empowering women and not the other way around.\"\" There is almost as much speculation surrounding who will create Kate's wedding gown as there is for the \"\"Other Kate\"\". She is rumoured to have ditched plans for her friend John Galliano to design the bridal dress after he was fired from Christian Dior in disgrace over his alleged anti-Semitic outburst in Paris last month. Kate Halfpenny, who dressed Kate in a vintage gown for her 35th birthday party, is another name being circulated. Miss Moss is currently in Hong Kong, to open a flagship Longchamp store. She designs a collection of handbags for the luxury brand and cut the ribbon and the grand opening yesterday.

A new study by researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato validates a promising new approach for extending life span and treating age-related diseases. The study appears in the March 30 online edition of the prestigious scientific journal Nature. The study found that a dye, used in laboratories to detect Alzheimer's disease, extended the life span of nematode worms by more than 50 percent and slowed the disease process in worms bred to mimic aspects of Alzheimer's disease. The dye is also known as Thioflavin T. Nematodes make excellent subjects for research on aging. Researchers don't have to wait long for results because the tiny worms live only two or three weeks normally, and the nematodes' genetic code has been mapped. It was research on nematodes more than two decades ago that first revealed to scientists that the aging process could be extended via genetic mutations. It had long been believed that aging was an uncontrollable process of deterioration that couldn't be altered by single genes. Since then, researchers at the Buck Institute and elsewhere have identified hundreds of genes that affect the life span of nematodes as well as compounds that can trigger the anti-aging effect. Until now, however, scientists didn't know the mechanism at work. \"\"What's new and exciting about this study is we think we know what is going on,\"\" said Gordon Lithgow, the Buck faculty member who led the research study. The study highlights a process called protein homeostasis, the ability of an organism to maintain the proper structure and balance of its proteins, which are the building blocks of life. \"\"Proteins have a certain three-dimensional shape and if that shape is lost by clumping or other types of damage their function is lost as well,\"\" Lithgow said. \"\"This is well studied in relation to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other diseases.\"\" While many degenerative diseases have been linked to a breakdown in the process, genetic studies have long indicated that protein homeostasis is a major contributor to longevity in complex animals. \"\"We've had a hunch for a long time that protein homeostasis would be a driving factor for normal aging, and I think that's what we're seeing here,\"\" Lithgow said of the study. \"\"Somehow these compounds slow the clumping of the proteins together and consequently that slows down normal aging. \"\"We have been looking for compounds that slow aging for more than 10 years and Thioflavin T is the best we have so far,\"\" Lithgow said. Aided by a $1.7 million grant from the Petaluma-based Larry L. Hillblom Foundation in 2007, Buck Institute scientists tested 120,000 chemical compounds on yeast and nematode worms in search of compounds that would slow the aging process. But Thioflavin T was not part of that process, Lithgow said. Testing Thioflavin T was the idea of Silvestre Alavez, a staff scientist in the Lithgow lab. Alavez was trained in neuroscience and knew about the use of these compounds to detect disease-related proteins. Several other compounds he identified have also proven effective in increasing life span in worms. One of those is curcumin, the active ingredient in the popular Indian spice turmeric. \"\"People have been making claims about the health benefits of curcumin for many years,\"\" Alavez said. \"\"Maybe slowing aging is part of the mechanism of action.\"\" Curcumin is being tested in several human clinical trials for conditions ranging from colon cancer to rheumatoid arthritis to depression. Alavez said, \"\"Any small molecule that maintains protein homeostasis during aging could be active against multiple disease states.\"\" Follow-up research on Thioflavin T is underway at the Buck Institute in mice bred to have Alzheimer's. One of the members of the research team that worked on the study was David Zucker, 23, a Dominican University student who is working on his master's degree. Zucker's ambition is to become a physician and he is in the process of sending out applications to medical schools. Now he can mention that his name is attached to a study published by Nature. \"\"I lucked out, I guess,\"\" Zucker said.

The former chief technology officer of Microsoft is an executive at DreamWorks Animation, once studied with Stephen Hawking and donated Tyrannosaurus rex fossils he uncovered in Montana to the Smithsonian. He was profiled by Malcolm Gladwell, is a pal of Bill Gates and spent the last several years working on \"\"Modernist Cuisine,\"\" an encyclopedic six-volume compendium of cutting-edge cooking that is not only one of the most expensive cookbooks ever published (the list price is $625, though it's available on Amazon.com for a mere $461.62) but also one of the heaviest, a fire-door-stopper that tips the scales at more than 40 pounds. An initial print run of 6,000 editions has already sold out. Even more exciting for baristas and home brewers, there's an entire chapter on coffee, 50 thick pages devoted to the topic. In culinary circles coffee is often a second-class subject, not worth the ink. In \"\"Modernist Cuisine\"\" it's treated seriously, and takes its place right next to a section on wine. The chapter is essentially a detailed primer. It outlines how coffee is processed, stored and roasted, and discusses the best grinders (conical burr) and the best temperature for drinking (not scalding hot). \"\"Modernist Cuisine\"\" has a boys-with-toys current running through it, so most of the chapter is devoted to espresso and assumes that you have access to a professional or prosumer machine and dream of pulling the perfect shot. I could almost see Mark Prince nodding in approval from across the continent. There's no knocking the meticulous research that went into the chapter (there's a lucid explanation of how coffee is extracted), the conclusions (darker roasts don't mean stronger coffee) or the overall sensibility (Myhrvold is right, restaurant coffee should be better), but there isn't anything new here for the coffee nut. If you read Tim Wendelboe or Scott Rao, check in with Matt Buchanan at Gizmodo or James Hoffmann at jimseven, or even let yourself meander into a conversation with a chatty barista - you'll already be familiar with much of what's in the chapter, if not all of it. It's a shame, because \"\"Modernist Cuisine\"\" is quickly becoming known for educating the educated, either by systematizing techniques (in his review for The New York Times, Michael Rhulman writes: \"\"The table for custard lets you pick your desired consistency based on what percentage of egg you use and the temperature you cook it to, to create a thick Anglaise-style sauce or a stand-alone custard. I tested it, it's brilliant, I'll use it forever.\"\") or by explaining the arcane (John Lancaster of The New Yorker seemed fascinated to learn that because water boils at a higher temperature in New York City than in Mexico City, ovens effectively bake at higher temperatures in New York City than in Mexico City). Too bad Myhrvold doesn't do either with coffee. The espresso how-to won't hold any surprises for somebody who watches a professional at work, never mind the curious customer who takes an hour-long class at the local coffee shop. The book doesn't even have a single photo of coffee gear sliced open with an abrasive water-jet cutter. (The cross-section of a flaming grill in action has become an iconic image from the book.) There's a Synesso espresso machine with the front plate removed, but that's too easy. Maybe that's the point. If the chapter won't blow any minds within coffee, it might indoctrinate a generation of chefs and home cooks who never spent much time thinking about grinders or roast profiles. This probably won't sit well with Myhrvold, who can't handle qualified praise. So instead of fixating on shortcomings, I'll spend a moment with something he does well: express his fanatical love of espresso. In a short passage he recalls confronting his skepticism of the so-called \"\"God shot,\"\" an espresso so transcendent that it changes your life. Myhrvold writes: Then one day at the Coffee Fest trade show in Seattle, a barista named Daniel Humphries of Victrola Coffee pulled me a shot of their Streamline roast in one of the earliest Synesso machines. \"\"It was like nothing else I have ever tasted, a phenomenal and complex layering of flavors. Yes, it was coffee, but with a richness and complexity unlike those of any coffee I'd had before - unlike anything else I'd ever tasted, for that matter. \u2026 I walked around the rest of the day haunted by that taste; it was with me for hours. \"\"I'd had my first God shot. \"\"Of course now I feel foolish for doubting that God shots exist. Yes, the language used by coffee lovers to describe them is over the top, but that's because the experience itself is, too.\"\" Preach it, brother.", "crime-20907926": "Mossad's not so secret operation. A scandal is flaring up after the arrest of a Palestinian engineer was confirmed by the Israeli government. Dirar Abu Sisi, suspected of links with Hamas, vanished from a train near Kiev on February 19, allegedly kidnapped by Mossad. Dirar Abu Sisi appeared in court on Thursday for a hearing on extending his detention. Prosecutors asked the court to allow the Palestinian to be held for five more days after which he would be officially charged. At this stage, the story seems to have more questions than answers. The Palestinian engineer went missing while traveling from the Ukrainian city of Kharkov to Kiev. Two men reportedly walked into his compartment, produced IDs of special services officers and removed him from the train. A sequence of mysterious events then unfolded, confusing not only the family of the kidnapped engineer and the media, but even the Ukrainian officials. Some reported that he turned up at the Israeli prison the next day after he had been abducted; later a number of media reported the same information but only on March 10. Israeli authorities officially confirmed this report on March 20, when the Israeli court bowed to human rights activists and admitted that Sisi was being kept in jail in Israel, according to Itar-Tass news agency. Finally, the situation became more or less clear when the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly admitted on Thursday that the man had indeed been kept in prison in Israel saying: \"\"Abu Sisi is a Hamas member. He is being held in Israel. He supplied us with valuable information.\"\" But Netanyahu did not elaborate. Abu Sisi's alleged connection to Hamas was named by the media, almost straight away, as one of the reasons for such drastic actions. However, both he and his Ukrainian wife Veronika deny all allegations. Moreover, Veronika appealed to the UN High Commission for Refugees to address the issue. She believes that the kidnapping was performed by the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad. \"\"How can I explain to my children that their father wasn't killed by a bomb in Palestine but disappeared from a train in a democratic country?\"\" she told Ukraine's Kyiv Post. According to Abu Sisi's account that he gave to the lawyer who was allowed to visit him in jail - from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCRH), a Gaza-based NGO - the people who abducted him on the train wore Ukrainian military uniform, they took his documents by force, then removed him from the train and drove him to Kiev. He says he was held and interrogated in an apartment by individuals who identified themselves as members of Mossad. Another reason for such actions, as speculated by the Israeli media, is Sisi's possible connection to the kidnapping of an Israeli Defense Forces soldier, Gilad Schalit, and the belief that Sisi knows his current whereabouts. Noam Shalit, the father of abducted IDF soldier, even called on the family of the detained Palestinian engineer on Thursday to pressure Hamas to reach a deal that would bring about the release of his son, reports Israeli Haaretz newspaper. After appearing in court on Thursday, Abu Sisi, when asked, told the press: \"\"I don't know anything about Gilad Shalit. I don't know anything. I'm an engineer,\"\" as quoted by The Guardian. According to the Jerusalem Post's report on Friday, when asked about the possibility of Sisi being exchanged for Schalit, prime minister Netanyahu declined to comment. However, Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, in an interview to Israel Army radio said that: \"\"He didn't organize the abduction or guard Schalit but he is a person with intimate internal information on Hamas.\"\" What seems to be particularly intriguing in the whole story is how exactly the engineer was removed from Ukraine. RT spoke to a former security officer in the country who said that in case of a planned operation between the two countries' intelligence services, the man would simply be arrested quietly and deported. In this case, however, both the Ukrainian intelligence and the Interior Ministry have said they had no idea of such a plan by their Israeli counterparts. Moreover, Ukraine's Interior Minister, Aleksandr Mogilyov, is set to visit Israel, to try to find out more details behind the operation, which the Ukrainian side claims it was not notified about. The unfolding story, a thriller of its kind, is not the first time that Israeli intelligence has undertaken such acts. In January 2010, a man believed to be connected to the Hamas terrorist cell, was assassinated in a hotel in Dubai. Eleven men with fake French, Irish and other passports were put on the international wanted list by the UAE. However, that story seems far from being resolved, despite the fact that Israel did not deny Mossad's involvement."}
